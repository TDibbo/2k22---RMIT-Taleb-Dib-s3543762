						<h2>Why im interested in IT</h2>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">I have a Certificate IV in Information Technology that was achieved back in 2018 at Melbourne Polytechnic. I've since captured a position in Level 1 IT Help Desk, a specialised job that involves strong ethical assistance & support. The support supplied ranges from systematic/hardware problems to software application complications. My day-to-day operation does involve a vast list of programs/applications such as;</p>
							<p style="color:red; font-size:11px;">Active Directory</p>
							<p style="color:orange; font-size:11px;">OKTA</p>
							<p style="color:blue; font-size:11px;">Azure Microsoft</p> 
							<p style="color:green; font-size:11px;">o365 Admin Centre</p> 
							<p style="color:gold; font-size:11px;">AWS Workspace management</p>
							<p style="color:purple; font-size:11px;">Virtual Desktop (Remote Connections)</p> 
							<p style="color:brown; font-size:11px;">Teamviewer+Connectwise</p> 
							<p style="color:pink; font-size:11px;">Salesforce support</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">I have had the opportunity to support users by creating tutorial videos to help educate our users;</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:9px;"> here is one of my videos I created for the business.</p>
							<iframe width="400" height="230" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDWwhK939D4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="2" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">The purpose of joining RMIT & this course is to help enhance my current knowledge of Information Technology & to guide me into other fields of interest. I have experienced almost 3 years of Level 1 Help Desk Support, have collected that group work is the key to success as every member involved contributes new content to the other members, for the succession of the task. I personally would not have come this far without the help and assistance of my peers, their guidance has allowed me to pursue deeper into the world of IT.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">I have had a lot interest around Security, Gaming (Designing) & learning program language. As one of my hobbies in life is playing games on a PC & have been doing so for good portion of my life. So naturally, my interest for coding, making my own world that players could join in & explore is something that I've become fond of. I have had many inspirations coming from games such as; Minecraft, Cube World, Trove, Albion Online, Oldshcool Runescape. As you can imagine from a child playing these video games, you would come across many malicious sites & bad intentional means to snatch and steal your belongings. I became very aware of these operations at an early age and did a lot of researching and knowledge gathering around how to be aware of these security risks. An addition to the early awakening, my job has enhanced the protocols that are required to ensure users have not leaked & provided more than they should & what to do if the matter has been escalated to Top Priority.</p>

						<p style="color:black; font-size:15px;"><i><b>Personality Max</b></i></p>
							<a href= "https://personalitymax.com/report/?pt=42-47-47-74&mi=83-90-97-83-73-67-63-80&ls=90-82-85&bh=48&name_key=d6776c9d78" target="_blank"><p style="color:black; font-size:11px">Click here for full report</p></a>
								<p style="color:black; font-size:9px">Personalitymax has identified myself as an INFJ. As per the description of 'The Confidant' - INFJ. "INFJs are complex, deep and intensely private. Their life's mission is to develop and guide others. Personal growth drives them and anything short of that pursuit is meaningless to them. They are passionate and devoted to the causes they believe in. INFJs live their life with a great sense of purpose." I could not agree more or less with this description of an INFJ, the resemblance is intimidating and direct.</p>

								<p style="color:black; font-size:9px;">As per ENFJ-A personality type; There is a strong connection with this personality type and myself as a person. I do have a lot of similarities when it comes to working in a professional environment. Bold and Confidence is a strong People Mastery strategy that i have carried on throughout my time working at Level 1 Help Desk., which does bring out the Diplomat role that i carry out to ensure all tasks in relation to the business needs are completed on time without doubt.</p>

								<p style="color:black; font-size:9px;">As per testmycreativity results, it has encouraged me to work on area's that may need assistance in. As i can see that my creativity score is 56.13 - I do believe that this could be much greater but it will be a work-in-progress to uplift my metrics.</p>
