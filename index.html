						<h2>Why im interested in IT</h2>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">I have a Certificate IV in Information Technology that was achieved back in 2018 at Melbourne Polytechnic. I've since captured a position in Level 1 IT Help Desk, a specialised job that involves strong ethical assistance & support. The support supplied ranges from systematic/hardware problems to software application complications. My day-to-day operation does involve a vast list of programs/applications such as;</p>
							<p style="color:red; font-size:11px;">Active Directory</p>
							<p style="color:orange; font-size:11px;">OKTA</p>
							<p style="color:blue; font-size:11px;">Azure Microsoft</p> 
							<p style="color:green; font-size:11px;">o365 Admin Centre</p> 
							<p style="color:gold; font-size:11px;">AWS Workspace management</p>
							<p style="color:purple; font-size:11px;">Virtual Desktop (Remote Connections)</p> 
							<p style="color:brown; font-size:11px;">Teamviewer+Connectwise</p> 
							<p style="color:pink; font-size:11px;">Salesforce support</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">I have had the opportunity to support users by creating tutorial videos to help educate our users;</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:9px;"><i> here is one of my videos I created for the business.</i></p>
							<iframe width="400" height="230" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDWwhK939D4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="2" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">The purpose of joining RMIT & this course is to help enhance my current knowledge of Information Technology & to guide me into other fields of interest. I have experienced almost 3 years of Level 1 Help Desk Support, have collected that group work is the key to success as every member involved contributes new content to the other members, for the succession of the task. I personally would not have come this far without the help and assistance of my peers, their guidance has allowed me to pursue deeper into the world of IT.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">I have had a lot interest around Security, Gaming (Designing) & learning program language. As one of my hobbies in life is playing games on a PC & have been doing so for good portion of my life. So naturally, my interest for coding, making my own world that players could join in & explore is something that I've become fond of. I have had many inspirations coming from games such as; Minecraft, Cube World, Trove, Albion Online, Oldshcool Runescape. As you can imagine from a child playing these video games, you would come across many malicious sites & bad intentional means to snatch and steal your belongings. I became very aware of these operations at an early age and did a lot of researching and knowledge gathering around how to be aware of these security risks. An addition to the early awakening, my job has enhanced the protocols that are required to ensure users have not leaked & provided more than they should & what to do if the matter has been escalated to Top Priority.</p>

							<img src="images/responsibility.PNG" width="300" border="2">
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">This job is very appealing to me because it requires a critical thinker & someone who is able to provide direcitons and support to all involved groups.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">Digital Technical Lead/Solution Architect do have a very busy schedule due to their extensive above and beyond delivery. The job application has a list of requirements which does involve basic to very high-levels of information technology holds. This job demonstrates multiple digital technologies and channels such as; Websites, Mobile Apps, Notification platform and API-led integration. As stated in the 'About You' section it breaks down the ideal candidate should demonstrate to secure the job.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">In my current state, my qualifications do not meet the requirements of the job but this is a stepping stone to understand what pathway I must follow. Understanding the complex requirements does encourage and motivate me to seek further work to acquire more certifications.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">My key strategy to obtaining this job position is to reach out to the people I work with and attempt to obtain work-experience. On-top of that seeking further studies/subjects to focus on what an Digital Technical Lead/Solution Architect entails & their general responsibilities. Understanding what their day-to-day tasks will be a great opportunity to be apart of.</p>

								<p style="color:blue; font-size:9px">Personalitymax has identified myself as an INFJ. As per the description of 'The Confidant' - INFJ. "INFJs are complex, deep and intensely private. Their life's mission is to develop and guide others. Personal growth drives them and anything short of that pursuit is meaningless to them. They are passionate and devoted to the causes they believe in. INFJs live their life with a great sense of purpose." I could not agree more or less with this description of an INFJ, the resemblance is intimidating and direct.</p>

								<p style="color:blue; font-size:9px;">As per ENFJ-A personality type; There is a strong connection with this personality type and myself as a person. I do have a lot of similarities when it comes to working in a professional environment. Bold and Confidence is a strong People Mastery strategy that i have carried on throughout my time working at Level 1 Help Desk., which does bring out the Diplomat role that i carry out to ensure all tasks in relation to the business needs are completed on time without doubt.</p>

					<h3 style="color:MediumSlateBlue; background-color:black;"><u>My Project Idea</u></h3><hr>
						<p style="color:red; font-size:15px;"><b>Weighing Needs</b></p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">An iOS/android application that will integrate the touch-screen mechanic to be applied when attempting to weigh any sort of substances, this will introduce a real-time digital scaler for all users. The intended purpose for developing a real-time digital scaler that at the convenience of the user, to provide an application necessity for all weighing needs.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">Create an application that allows Smartphones and Tablets to act as weighing scales. The intention behind it is to create a diverse application that requires code that is interactive with whatever substance is placed onto the device. The project will involve experimentation to deliver the indented purpose of creation, it will pursue an end of weight testing to understand what minimum threshold is required for measurement to begin.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">As touch-screen devices work off electrical circuits, a mechanism will be integrated similar to how touch-screen devices operate, a compartment will be designed to be the container for weighing any type of substances. This container will be built around how touch-screen currently operates, acting as an electrical circuit to be recognised by the tablet & begin the weighing process. As this knowledge expands with the compartment, it will be deemed as a test subject to mimic the household tools available.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">iPhone had created '3D Touch', this feature has been discontinued due to its complications. Though, it was an active function that people used for real-time scaling. This was introduced back in 2015, as intended the purpose of this function was to permanently change how touchscreen devices operated. As quoted "Apps and games will never feel the same again.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">This technology had allowed the greater community of Apple iOS to venture into the world of 3D Touch. As per many online references reminiscing the advanced technology that Apple had to offer. The idea was removed from existence and replaced with software development to replicate the properties without requiring pressure-sensitive hardware layer. Reinventing the wheel is always used in history, and it will be reinvented</p>
						
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">The software "Weighing Needs" will contain a user-friendly appearance & an adjustable scale dependent on the smartphone/tablet device (As there a multiple resolution sizes, it will adapt towards the size difference). It will also provide an interface that will interact with the user to adjust any settings to suit their property need. The properties involved will be responsive & functionable returning direct and precise answers. As the interface is user friendly, it will also provide notification pop-ups for first-time users. Allowing the educational stream of guidance to enable the software gets used correctly.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">This will require an application coder that is proficient in 3D Touch properties entail. It will require long hours of in-depth analysis to understand weight experimenting across a broad variety of mobile devices. As experimentation is actioned on a complex playing field, it will be administered to ensure successful output responses.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">As iOS & Android are two separate motherships, they require specific programming language to develop on their territory. Due to the extensive and harsh criticism that Apple's guideline presents, ensuring that all aspects are met. Full analysis will need to be applied towards the construction of Weighing Need's on an iOS platform. Android is a lot more relaxed compared to Apple's extensive critique, it allows the developer to simply upload an .apk file to be published onto Google Play.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:13px;">Further insights of what specific requirements that both platforms require. </p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">With Apple iOS it does require proficiency in either Objective-C or Swift programming. This is not to say that an app can be developed purely on these language platforms, the Apple IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Xcode is required. Xcode IDE is a graphical interface that provides a complete set of tools for application creation on iOS platform. The iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) also includes a variety of APIs and frameworks providing access to additional features to enhance the application uses & implement features such as; Siri, Notifications, Maps, Touch ID, social networks etc. Last but not least, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program. This membership simply provides more tools & resources.</p>
						<p style="color:black; font-size:11px;">The main programming languages that are used for Android devices are Visual C #, C ++ and Java. The most preferred language used is Java due to its simplicity of operating an application. The breakdown of application creation on Android is; Java is referred to being the logic of the program, XML is the representation of the program. After these two key points are finalised, then acquiring the assembly tool to compile all the files and package them together into an .apk file. </p>
						<p style="color:blakc; font-size:11px;">This will be attracting a wide-range of customers that will require scales for selling purposes. This will be handy and convenient involving our daily devices to have more utility equipped for more customers. This will increase more demand in acquiring devices that suit the audience whether it is based on size, brand or price, the application will be available for all devices.</p>
